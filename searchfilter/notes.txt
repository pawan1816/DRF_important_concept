In Django REST Framework (DRF), filtering and searching can be implemented using built-in FilterBackend classes or the third-party django-filter package. 
Using DRF's Built-in SearchFilter
The SearchFilter class provides a simple, single query parameter-based search functionality (defaulting to the query parameter search) similar to the Django admin interface. 
Steps
Add SearchFilter to filter_backends: Include the filter backend in your view or globally in settings.py.
Define search_fields: Specify the model fields (typically CharField or TextField) that the search query should match against. 
Example (views.py)
python
from rest_framework import filters
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ['name', 'description']
Usage
You can then make a GET request using a ?search query parameter, e.g., http://api.example.com/products/?search=laptop. 
Advanced Search Lookups
You can customize the search behavior for specific fields by prepending special characters in search_fields: 
^ : Starts-with search (e.g., ['^name'])
= : Exact matches (e.g., ['=name'])
$ : Regex search (e.g., ['$name'])
@ : Full-text search (currently only for PostgreSQL) (e.g., ['@name']) 
By default, the search uses case-insensitive partial matches (icontains). 
Using the django-filter Package
For more complex and customizable filtering based on specific field lookups (e.g., equality, range, etc.), the django-filter library is recommended. 
Steps
Install django-filter: pip install django-filter.
Add to INSTALLED_APPS: Add 'django_filters' to your settings.py file.
Add DjangoFilterBackend to filter_backends: 
Example (views.py)
python
from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Product
from .serializers import ProductSerializer

class ProductListView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
    filter_backends = [DjangoFilterBackend]
    filterset_fields = ['category', 'is_discontinued']
Usage
This allows filtering by specific field names in the URL, e.g., http://api.example.com/products/?category=electronics&is_discontinued=False. 
For highly advanced filtering requirements, you can define a custom FilterSet class for fine-grained control over lookups and relationships. More details are available in the Django Filters documentation.
